# automatic reservasitios

For https://reservasitios.demohiberus.com/

Will mark yourself as present everyday in the morning. An existing reservation needs to already exists.

## Automatic usage

1. Fork the repository
2. Go to Settings -> secrets and variables -> Actions
3. Add a USERNAME repository secret with your username

There is an [action](.github/workflows/cron.yml) configured to automatically run the script everyday at the morning. You can adapt as needed if necessary (or create an [issue](https://github.com/anayaHiberus/reservasitios/issues)/[pr](https://github.com/anayaHiberus/reservasitios/pulls) to discuss it).

## Contribution

If you find any issue just create an [issue](https://github.com/anayaHiberus/reservasitios/issues), a [pr](https://github.com/anayaHiberus/reservasitios/pulls), send me an email...whatever you prefer.
